NOTE:

These Build-You-Own Six Flags parks were originally started in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Triple Thrill Pack. Some were later partially played in OpenRCT2 to speed up gameplay.

Because RCT2 and OpenRCT2 handle game timing differently, certain parks (most notably Six Flags Holland and Magic Mountain) may cause an “Access Violation” crash in RCT2 after the win celebration ends. All parks were tested and do open and complete correctly in RCT2, and the win will still be recorded even if the crash occurs.

In my experience, immediately pausing the game after winning and then closing the file helps prevent the error. These files run fully and normally in OpenRCT2. For Best Results, do not double-click to open these files in RCT2, but open within the game.

All files are provided AS IS, with no warranty or guarantees. Use at your own discretion.

Enjoy!
