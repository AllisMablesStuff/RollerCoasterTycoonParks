Place the "Campaigns" directory in this save file package into your [My Documents]\RCT3\ folder. This new Campaigns folder will merge with the existing one on your computer, creating a new campaign for each expansion pack. Open RCT3, select an expansion pack, and open the "Near-win parks" campaign. All scenarios will be unlocked for playing. However, you will need to open each scenario and let it win to unlock locked roller-coaster designs. Your old campaigns will be unaffected.
