Note:

Some of these Six Flags inspired parks were played in a “rough” manner and make use of tricks and quirks of the game. The goal was simply to complete the scenario, not to create a realistic or fully functional park.

Any tactics used in these parks, such as the trapping of guests, are purely fictional and exist only to exploit the game engine for fast scenario completion. They should not be interpreted as reflecting the status of, or my opinion of, Six Flags parks in real life. The author does not condone treating real people this way in any context.

Enjoy your shiny white check mark in your RCT Classic scenario table!

---------UPDATE!----------
These scenarios have since been replayed with properly functional parks! See the "RCT2 Triple Thrill Pack\RCT2 Build Your Own Six Flags Parks" directory.
